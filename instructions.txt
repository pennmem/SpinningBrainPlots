Install Environment
  conda env create -f brainPlot2.yml

  If anything fails and you need to run it again to update it, use the following command
    conda env update -n brainPlot2 -f nora.yml
  If gnu readlines fails, you can just remove the whole line from the yml file and run the update command
  If an existing installation of vtk is already installed by your system, you can 
    1) remove it from you system and run the update command
    2) remove it from the yml file (if the version is 8.2.0) and run the update command
